This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". It contains 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to first download the data and extract it into ./Exploratory Data Analysis: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
Then download the R scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R).
